# Week 02 – Pomodoro Tracker

This project is a simple study timer based on the Pomodoro technique.  
You choose how many minutes you want to focus, the timer counts down, and when the session ends it logs your progress into a text file.

**What this project does:**
- Lets you enter a custom session length  
- Counts down the time  
- Marks one Pomodoro as complete  
- Saves your daily total in `pomodoro-log.txt`

**What I learned:**
- Using loops for timers  
- Pausing code with `Thread.sleep()`  
- Writing simple logs to a file  
- Basic date handling in Java

This builds on the idea of developing small, practical tools while improving my Java skills each week.
