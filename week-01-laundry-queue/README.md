# Week 01 – Dorm Laundry Queue Simulator

This program simulates a dorm laundry room with a few washing machines and students waiting in line.  
Each machine takes one load at a time and we track when every job starts, ends, and how long it waits.

**What I learned:**  
- Using classes and lists in Java  
- Working with queues  
- Simple scheduling logic  
- Printing clean output

Next step: try adding a “small loads finish sooner” rule.
