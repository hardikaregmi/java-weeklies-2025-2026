# Java Weeklies 2025

Hi, I’m Hardika.  
I’m a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern Mississippi.  
I’m starting this repo to practice Java every week and get better at software engineering, one project at a time.

For four weeks; Each week I’ll post a small project — something useful or just fun to build.
