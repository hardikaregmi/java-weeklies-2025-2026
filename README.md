# Java Weeklies 2025–2026 

Hi, I’m Hardika.  
I’m a junior studying Computer Science at the University of Southern Mississippi.  
I’m starting this repo to practice Java every week and get better at software engineering, one project at a time.

Each week I’ll post a small project — something useful or just fun to build.  
The goal is to learn, stay consistent, and be ready for a software engineering internship by Summer 2026.

I’ll keep things simple and post updates every week.
